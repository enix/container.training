# Automation && CI/CD

We already achieved:

- Find a way to Develop our application

- Test it manualy, and explore the way to write automated test for it

- Package it the way we wanted it

- Ship the image to a registry

We now have to:

- Deploy it

And so each time is made a change on the repository. Can we automate this a little bit ?
